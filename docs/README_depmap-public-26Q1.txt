### Achilles

This Achilles dataset contains the results of genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens for Achilles (using Avana Cas9 and Humagne-CD Cas12 libraries) combined with Sanger's Project SCORE (KY Cas9 library) and BioGRID (Brunello and TKOv3 Cas9 libraries) screens.  

The dataset was processed using the following steps:
- Sum raw readcounts by SequenceID and collapse pDNAs by median (removing sequences with fingerprinting issues, total reads below 500000 or less then 25 mean reads per guide)
- Normalize readcounts such that pDNA sequences have the same mode, and all other sequences have median of nonessentials that matches the median of nonessentials in the corresponding pDNA batch
- Remove intergenic/non-targeting controls, Cas9 guides with multiple alignments to a gene, guides with >5 genomic alignments, and sgRNAs with inconsistent signal (see DropReason of guide maps).
- NA sgRNAs with pDNA counts less than one millionth of the pDNA pool
- Calculate the mean reads per guide for each sequence. Sequences with more than 185 mean reads per guide are considered passing.
- Compute the log2-fold-change (LFC) from pDNA counts for each sequence . Collapse to a gene-level by taking the median of guides.
- Calculate the Null-Normalized Median Difference (NNMD) from the LFC using the following equation: (median(essentials) - median(nonessentials)) / MAD(nonessentials).  Sequences must be below a threshold of -1.25 to be considered passing.
- Calculate the fraction of reads originating from the other library than what is annotated. The fraction of reads must be below a threshold of 0.1 to be considered passing.
- Calculate residual LFC for each library and replicate by creating a linear model of the replicate's LFC as a function of the mean LFC for each gene across replicates. Only genes that show high variance in gene effect across screens and libraries are considered when calculating residual LFC.  Specifically, this set of controls was identified by taking the intersection of the top 1250 genes with the highest variance gene effect from each library. This removes the influence of common essential dropout on replicate correlations. 
- Remove sequences that do not have a Pearson coefficient > .19 with at least one other replicate sequence for the same screen using the residual LFC. Remove sequences that have a Pearson coefficient > .8 with any other sequence that is not part of the same screen and is not the same lineage. This checks for inconsistent biology between replicates, or unexpected similarity to another screen.
- Calculate the NNMD for each screen after averaging passing sequences. Screen must be below a threshold of -1.25 to be considered passing.
- In each passing replicate, NA vectors if any contained sgRNA overlaps with a SNP in that cell line, either somatic or germline. Recompute LFC after correction.
- Compute the naive gene score by collapsing the passing LFC data to a screen x gene matrix using the median of all replicates for each screen and the median of sgRNAs for each gene.
- Prior to running Chronos, NA apparent outgrowths in readcounts.
- Run Chronos jointly on 2D screen type batch screens over all libraries to generate screen-level gene effect scores, where screen type batch 2D includes all standard, neurosphere, and anchor screens (2DS, 2DD, 2DN, 3DN, 2DND, 3DND). Use the chronos model trained on the 2D screen type batch screens to generate screen-level gene effect scores for 3D screen type batch screens, where screen type batch 3D includes all organoid screens (2DO, 3DO). 
- To correct proximity bias, the median gene effect of each chromosome arm is aligned to be the same across all screens. See Venceti et al. 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-024-03336-1) for more details on this correction.
- Concatenate gene effects from all libraries into a single ScreenGeneEffect matrix.
- Run Chronos jointly on 2D screen type batch models to generate model-level gene effect scores which are provided as CRISPRGeneEffectUncorrected, then use the chronos model trained on 2D screen type batch models to generate model-level gene effect scores for 3D screen type batch models. Perform the same corrections to CRISPRGeneEffectUncorrected as described above.
- Removal of Confounding Principal Components (RCPC): Preprocess CRISPRGeneEffect matrix by subtracting column mean and standardizing column variance. Perform PCA on preprocessed CRISPRGeneEffect matrix and correlate component loadings with median of common essential genes. Remove component loadings with Pearson correlation higher than 0.2 with common essential dropout. Multiply the truncated component loadings and principal components to revert back to the CRISPRGeneEffect matrix of original dimension. Add column mean and multiply column variance to CRISPRGeneEffect to revert back to the original scale prior to preprocessing. To learn more refer to (www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/720243v1).
- Using the CRISPRGeneEffect, identify pan-dependent genes as those for whom 90% of cell lines rank the gene above a given dependency cutoff. The cutoff is determined from the central minimum in a histogram of gene ranks in their 90th percentile least dependent line.
- For each Chronos gene effect score from both the ScreenGeneEffect and CRISPRGeneEffect, infer the probability that the score represents a true dependency. This is done using an EM step until convergence independently in each screen/model. The dependent distribution is given by the list of essential genes. The null distribution is determined from unexpressed gene scores in those cell lines that have expression data available, and from the nonessential gene list in the remainder.
- The remainder of the steps refer to processing paired screens using chronos-compare (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.24.650434).
- For each paired screen (the combination of a control screen ID and test screen ID), generate a paired condition map. A paired condition map must contain at least two passing sequences in each arm of the paired screen. For drug-anchor screens, the screen days must match exactly between arms. For resistance screens, the number of timepoints must be equivalent between the two arms. Each sequence is then assigned a condition (control or test). Any paired screens that fail to meet these criteria will be dropped. 
- Run chronos-compare independently for each set of paired screens. In short, we train one chronos model where we distinguish between the conditions (control vs. test) and a second where we don't (i.e. we treat all replicates as belonging to the same screen); if gene dependencies differ between the two conditions, the first model will fit the data better (i.e. have higher likelihood). To assign p-values to this likelihood comparison we shuffle condition labels to generate a null distribution of likelihood differences. 
-Concatenate chronos-compare outputs for paired screens with the same library. Within each library, scale all gene effects for each arm. This is done by first subtracting the median of the nonessential controls and dividing by the median of the common essential controls. Then recalculate the gene_effect_difference between the control and test arms using the scaled gene effects.

The essential  and nonessential controls used throughout the analysis are the Hart reference nonessentials and the intersection of the Hart and Blomen essentials. See Hart et al., Mol. Syst. Biol, 2014 and Blomen et al., Science, 2015. They are provided with this release as AchillesCommonEssentialControls.csv and AchillesNonessentialControls.csv. 


### Expression

DepMap expression data for genes and transcripts(TPMs) is quantified from RNAseq files using Salmon version v1.10.0 (Patro et al April 2017). Raw counts are quantified by STAR v2.7.11b. For code and configuration details, see https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap-omics-rna/tree/main/workflows/quantify_sr_rna. Based on Gencode v38.

### Copy number

For details on WGS relative copy number generation pipeline, see: <https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap_omics> and <https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap-omics-wgs/tree/main/workflows/call_cnvs>.

WES relative copy number data is generated by running the GATK copy number pipeline aligned to hg38. Tutorials and descriptions of this method can be found here https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11682, https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11683. **DepMap is no longer profiling cell lines using WES, so this dataset is not actively maintained.**

Absolute copy number data from WGS/WES is generated using PureCN (https://scfbm.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13029-016-0060-z). **not actively maintained*

### Mutations

DepMap mutation calls are generated using Mutect2 and annotated and filtered downstream. Variants are aligned to hg38. Detailed documentation can be found here https://storage.googleapis.com/shared-portal-files/Tools/26Q1_Mutation_Pipeline_Documentation.pdf.

### Fusions

DepMap generates RNAseq based fusion calls using 2.5.0 (Uhrig et al March 2021). For code and configuration details, see https://github.com/broadinstitute/depmap-omics-rna/tree/main/workflows/call_sr_rna_fusions. Based on Gencode v38.
